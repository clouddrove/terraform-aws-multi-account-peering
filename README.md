We eat, drink, sleep and most importantly love **DevOps**. We are working towards strategies for standardizing architecture while ensuring security for the infrastructure. We are strong believer of the philosophy <b>Bigger problems are always solved by breaking them into smaller manageable problems</b>. Resonating with microservices architecture, it is considered best-practice to run database, cluster, storage in smaller <b>connected yet manageable pieces</b> within the infrastructure. 

This module is basically combination of [Terraform open source](https://www.terraform.io/) and includes automatation tests and examples. It also helps to create and improve your infrastructure with minimalistic code instead of maintaining the whole infrastructure code yourself.

We have [*fifty plus terraform modules*][terraform_modules]. A few of them are comepleted and are available for open source usage while a few others are in progress.




## Prerequisites

This module has a few dependencies: 

- [Terraform 1.x.x](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html)
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [github.com/stretchr/testify/assert](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)







## Examples


**IMPORTANT:** Since the `master` branch used in `source` varies based on new modifications, we suggest that you use the release versions [here](https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-multi-account-peering/releases).


### Simple Example
Here are an example of how you can use this module in your inventory structure:
```hcl
  module "vpc-peering" {
        source            = "clouddrove/multi-account-peering/aws"
        version           = "0.15.0"
        name              = "vpc-peering"
        environment       = "test"
        label_order       = ["environment", "name"]
        enable_peering    = true
        accepter_role_arn = "arn:aws:iam::XXXXXXXXXXXX:role/assume-role"
        accepter_region   = "eu-west-1"
        requestor_vpc_id  = "vpc-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        acceptor_vpc_id   = "vpc-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
       }
```






## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| accepter\_region | The region of acceptor vpc. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| accepter\_role\_arn | The Role ARN of accepter AWS account. | `string` | `""` | no |
| acceptor\_allow\_remote\_vpc\_dns\_resolution | Allow acceptor VPC to resolve public DNS hostnames to private IP addresses when queried from instances in the requestor VPC. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| acceptor\_vpc\_id | Acceptor VPC ID. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`). | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| enable\_peering | Set to false to prevent the module from creating or accessing any resources. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| environment | Environment (e.g. `prod`, `dev`, `staging`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| label\_order | Label order, e.g. `name`,`application`. | `list(any)` | `[]` | no |
| managedby | ManagedBy, eg 'CloudDrove' | `string` | `"hello@clouddrove.com"` | no |
| name | Name  (e.g. `app` or `cluster`). | `string` | `""` | no |
| profile\_name | Name of aws profile. | `string` | `null` | no |
| repository | Terraform current module repo | `string` | `"https://github.com/clouddrove/terraform-aws-multi-account-peering"` | no |
| requestor\_allow\_remote\_vpc\_dns\_resolution | Allow requestor VPC to resolve public DNS hostnames to private IP addresses when queried from instances in the acceptor VPC. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| requestor\_vpc\_id | Requestor VPC ID. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. map(`BusinessUnit`,`XYZ`). | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| accept\_status | The status of the VPC peering connection request. |
| connection\_id | VPC peering connection ID. |
| tags | A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. |




## Testing
In this module testing is performed with [terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest) and it creates a small piece of infrastructure, matches the output like ARN, ID and Tags name etc and destroy infrastructure in your AWS account. This testing is written in GO, so you need a [GO environment](https://golang.org/doc/install) in your system. 

You need to run the following command in the testing folder:
```hcl
  go test -run Test
```
